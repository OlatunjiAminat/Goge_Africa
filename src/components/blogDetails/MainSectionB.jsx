            <p>The next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending ports.This could be a place close to home and sail in one area or start and finish in two different ports.Generally, starting and stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more convenient.You can also fly to a destination far from home and then sail another exotic sea.There are luxury yatch charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and Mediterrean seas or around Alaska, the Panama Canal, or any place you can imagine.</p>
